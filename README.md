They saw that the financial industry was in the midst of a major shift, with increasing amounts of data becoming available and a growing demand for new sources of data to inform investment decisions. Kamel and Thomas founded Quandl with the goal of democratizing access to financial data, making it easier and more affordable for individuals and organizations to access the data they need to make informed investment decisions. They focused on building a platform that would offer a wide range of data sets, with a strong emphasis on data quality, usability, and flexibility.

## Quandl's Business Activities

Quandl's primary goal is to provide financial professionals with easy access to high-quality financial and alternative data sets, which can help them make better-informed investment decisions, develop trading strategies, and conduct research. Quandl is trying to solve the problem of data fragmentation, which is a common issue in the financial industry.

Quandl aims to solve this problem by offering a centralized platform where customers can access a wide range of data sets from a variety of sources, all in one place.

In addition to data fragmentation, Quandl is also trying to solve the problem of data quality. Financial professionals need high-quality data to make accurate investment decisions, but it can be difficult to verify the quality of data from multiple sources.
