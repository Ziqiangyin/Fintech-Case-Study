An expert data analyst, Abraham handles all data-related operations for Quandl: identification, acquisition, curation, organization and dissemination. Abraham co-founded Quandl after a successful career on Wall Street, where he was the youngest trader at a multi-billion-dollar hedgefund. At this fund, Abraham conceived, designed and executed a number of quantitative data-driven investment strategies while managing a $300m arbitrage portfolio. [Tammer Kamel](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/tammer-kamel) is Quandl’s founder and CEO. Tammer created Quandl to solve a problem he encountered again and again in his 15-year career in finance: the time, effort and resources required to acquire and prepare data for analysis. Tammer programmed the first version of Quandl with the goal of making it easy for anyone to find and use high-qualitydata effectively in their professional decision-making.

Finding and formatting numerical data for analysis in R or Excel or indeed any application is a pain that all real world data analysts know all too well.  The solution to this problem is conceptually obvious: one site with all the world’s data, nicely formatted and documented; an omni-platform. The result is [www.quandl.com](https://demo.quandl.com/) as sort of "search engine" for numerical data.  The idea with Quandl is that you can find data fast.

Quandl has raised a total of CA$20.4M in funding over 4 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Aug 6, 2018 from a Venture [(1)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/quandl/company_financials).
