## Quandl's Business Activities

Quandl's primary goal is to provide financial professionals with easy access to high-quality financial and alternative data sets, which can help them make better-informed investment decisions, develop trading strategies, and conduct research.

In addition to data fragmentation, Quandl is also trying to solve the problem of data quality. Financial professionals need high-quality data to make accurate investment decisions, but it can be difficult to verify the quality of data from multiple sources.
