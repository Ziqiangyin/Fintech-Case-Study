An expert data analyst, Abraham handles all data-related operations for Quandl: identification, acquisition, curation, organization and dissemination. Abraham co-founded Quandl after a successful career on Wall Street, where he was the youngest trader at a multi-billion-dollar hedgefund. At this fund, Abraham conceived, designed and executed a number of quantitative data-driven investment strategies while managing a $300m arbitrage portfolio. [Tammer Kamel](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/tammer-kamel) is Quandl’s founder and CEO. Tammer created Quandl to solve a problem he encountered again and again in his 15-year career in finance: the time, effort and resources required to acquire and prepare data for analysis. Tammer programmed the first version of Quandl with the goal of making it easy for anyone to find and use high-qualitydata effectively in their professional decision-making.
