# **Case Study of Quandl**

## [Quandl: A Wikipedia for Time Series Data](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/02/quandl-a-wikipedia-for-time-series-data.html)

Quandl lnc. was incorporated in Sept 1st, 2011. Quandl is the premier source for financial, economic, and alternative datasets, serving investment professionals. Quandl’s platform is used by over 400,000 people, including analysts from the world’s top hedge funds, asset managers and investment banks.

Quandl was founded by Abraham Thomas and Tammer Kamel. [Abraham Thomas](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/abraham-thomas) is Quandl’s co-founder and Chief Data Officer. An expert data analyst, Abraham handles all data-related operations for Quandl: identification, acquisition, curation, organization and dissemination. Abraham co-founded Quandl after a successful career on Wall Street, where he was the youngest trader at a multi-billion-dollar hedgefund. At this fund, Abraham conceived, designed and executed a number of quantitative data-driven investment strategies while managing a $300m arbitrage portfolio. [Tammer Kamel](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/tammer-kamel) is Quandl’s founder and CEO. Tammer created Quandl to solve a problem he encountered again and again in his 15-year career in finance: the time, effort and resources required to acquire and prepare data for analysis. Tammer programmed the first version of Quandl with the goal of making it easy for anyone to find and use high-qualitydata effectively in their professional decision-making.

Finding and formatting numerical data for analysis in R or Excel or indeed any application is a pain that all real world data analysts know all too well.  The solution to this problem is conceptually obvious: one site with all the world’s data, nicely formatted and documented; an omni-platform. Quandl has built a sort of "universal data parser" which has thus far parsed about 2.8 million datasets. 

Quandl has raised a total of CA$20.4M in funding over 4 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Aug 6, 2018 from a Venture [(1)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/quandl/company_financials).
