# **Case Study of Quandl**

## [Quandl: A Wikipedia for Time Series Data](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/02/quandl-a-wikipedia-for-time-series-data.html)

*Quandl lnc.* was incorporated in Sept 1st, 2011. Quandl is the premier source for financial, economic, and alternative datasets, serving investment professionals. Quandl’s platform is used by over 400,000 people, including analysts from the world’s top hedge funds, asset managers and investment banks.

Quandl was founded by Abraham Thomas and Tammer Kamel. [Abraham Thomas](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/abraham-thomas) is Quandl’s co-founder and Chief Data Officer. An expert data analyst, Abraham handles all data-related operations for Quandl: identification, acquisition, curation, organization and dissemination. Abraham co-founded Quandl after a successful career on Wall Street, where he was the youngest trader at a multi-billion-dollar hedgefund. At this fund, Abraham conceived, designed and executed a number of quantitative data-driven investment strategies while managing a $300m arbitrage portfolio. [Tammer Kamel](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/tammer-kamel) is Quandl’s founder and CEO. Tammer created Quandl to solve a problem he encountered again and again in his 15-year career in finance: the time, effort and resources required to acquire and prepare data for analysis. Tammer programmed the first version of Quandl with the goal of making it easy for anyone to find and use high-qualitydata effectively in their professional decision-making.

Finding and formatting numerical data for analysis in R or Excel or indeed any application is a pain that all real world data analysts know all too well.  The solution to this problem is conceptually obvious: one site with all the world’s data, nicely formatted and documented; an omni-platform. The result is [www.quandl.com](https://demo.quandl.com/) as sort of "search engine" for numerical data.  The idea with Quandl is that you can find data fast.

Quandl has raised a total of CA$20.4M in funding over 4 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Aug 6, 2018 from a Venture [(1)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/quandl/company_financials).

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Financial analyst have probably spent weeks of my life trying to find data on the web.  And several more weeks validating, formatting and cleaning the data.  Analysis offers data scientists interesting, intellectually stimulating problems.  But data acquisition, the necessary precursor, offers only tedium and pain.  It's a time vampire. Quandl has built a sort of "universal data parser" which has thus far parsed about 2.8 million datasets. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
